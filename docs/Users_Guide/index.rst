**Foreword: A note to METplus Wrappers users**


This User's Guide is provided as an aid to users of the Model Evaluation
Tools (MET) and it's companion package METplus Wrappers. MET is a set of
verification tools developed and supported to community via the
Developmental Testbed Center (DTC) for use by the numerical weather
prediction community. METplus Wrappers is intended to be a suite of
Python wrappers and ancillary scripts to enhance the user's ability to
quickly set-up and run MET. Over the next few years, METplus Wrappers
will become the authoritative repository for verification of the Unified
Forecast System.

It is important to note here that METplus Wrappers is an evolving
software package. Previous releases of METplus Wrappers have occurred
since 2017. This documentation describes the 2.1 release in May 2019.
Intermediate releases may include bug fixes. METplus Wrappers is also be
able to accept new modules contributed by the community. If you have
code you would like to contribute, we will gladly consider your
contribution. While we are setting up our community contribution
protocol, please send email to: `met_help@ucar.edu <mailto:>`__ and
inform us of your desired contribution. We will then determine the
maturity of any new verification method and coordinate the inclusion of
the new module in a future version.

This User's Guide was prepared by the developers of the METplus
Wrappers, including Dan Adriaansen, Minna Win-Gildenmeister, Julie
Prestopnik, Jim Frimel, Mallory Row, John Halley Gotway, George McCabe,
Paul Prestopnik, Christana Kalb, Hank Fisher, Jonathan Vigh, Lisa
Goodrich, Tara Jensen, Tatiana Burek, and Bonny Strong.

**New for METplus Wrappers v3.0**

* Moved to using Python 3.6.3
* User environment variables ([user_env_vars]) and [FCST/OBS]_VAR<n>_[NAME/LEVEL/OPTIONS] now support filename template syntax, i.e. {valid?fmt=%Y%m%d%H}
* Added support for python embedding to supply gridded input data to MET tools (PcpCombine, GridStat, PointStat (gridded data only), RegridDataPlane...
* PcpCombine now supports custom user-defined commands to build atypical use case calls
* Improved logging to help debugging by listing expected file path
* CustomIngester wrapper added to allow python embedding for multiple data sources (in progress)
* Added support for month and year intervals for [INIT/VALID]_INCREMENT and LEAD_SEQ
* Addition of contributor/developer guide as part of documentation
* Documentation moved online using GitHub Pages and completely renamed, PDF option TBD.
* Bugfix: PcpCombine subtract mode will call add method with 1 file if processing accumulation data and the lead time is equal to the desired accumulation
* Bugfix: PcpCombine add mode forecast GRIB input
* Bugfix: PcpCombine sum mode no longer fails when input level is not explicitly specified
